    "My mind swirls like deep waters."
    "I brought my project to fruition; but what did I think? What was I thinking?"
    "I can't tell if I'm having a nightmare, or a dream, or some secret, third thing."
    "There's a stranger outside my door. They have no name."
    "I know their eyes. Their slender build is familiar to me."
    "I shouldn't have done this. I was just a wistful girl,"
    "just a whisper in my ear and like any other unwed maiden, I let myself be lead by temptation."
    "There they are just meters away from me. If I touched their skin, would they feel mine?"
    "If I was a year older and wiser, perhaps they wouldn't be there, knocking--perhaps only knocking in my mind."
    "My apartment, once so generous, seems so stifling now, and so cold a place."
    "I cannot do this. I cannot! If only like that maiden, there was another responsible, but not for this..."
    "I can't feel my breath."
    "I can hear {i}them{/i} breathing."
    "Gods above and below, I cannot just leave them."
    "Oh familiar inked pages, you cannot help. Dare I, with the lack of wisdom I have already shown, tell my dearest sister?"
    "If I tell her everything, would her insight bless me with courage?"
    "I must change the page I write on."

    """
    Dearest sister,

    I entrust you to treat this letter as any other that I have sent, that is,

    as the whole, if anecdotal, truth as I know it.

    I must add the disclaimer explicitly on this day's writing only because, were I not to have lived it myself,

    I would think someone telling me a ghost story merely to haunt my waking hours.

    {clear}

    Instead, Elizabeth, I am uncannily haunted by what I have experienced.

    My intent in sharing with you is not to scare you, but to keep unhidden what I have now made of my life.

    You may remember how seldom I returned your letters of late, since my passions consumed my literal and rhetorical ink in the lab, not at my desk...
